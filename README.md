# CI/CD Flutter Project

A comprehensive Flutter project with enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline, advanced security scanning, code quality gates, and containerization.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This project implements a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automatically builds, tests, scans for security vulnerabilities, and deploys the Flutter application across multiple platforms.

### Pipeline Triggers
- **Push to main branch**: Automatic pipeline execution
- **Pull requests to main**: Validation and testing
- **Manual trigger**: On-demand execution via `workflow_dispatch`

### Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline consists of 8 main jobs that run in parallel and sequential order:

    D --> E
    H --> F[Security Summary]

```
